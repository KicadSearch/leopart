# LEOPART
This is LEOPART, the fast easy search engine for electronic components in KicCad files on GitHub.

Gustav has 4 major components:
1. The Crawler (`crawler.py`) -- The crawler runs over GitHub and searches for KiCad files. The links and repo info is saved for further processing.
2. The Parser (`kicad_parser.py`) --  The parser fetches the found files from the first step and extracts the components from it.
3. The Validator (`validator.py`) -- Builds a copy of parts and their information for validation of found components.
4. The Search (`search.py`) and the Search Frontend (`app.py`) --  the search finds fitting components from the built database and presents it on a webpage
